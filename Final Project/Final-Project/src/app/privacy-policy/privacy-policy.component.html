        <p>
          TripAdvisor is an online service that provides recommendations for hotels, resorts, inns, vacations, travel
          packages, travel guides and lots more. Our website, mobile properties, and related applications (collectively,
          our “Website”) are part of the TripAdvisor® Media Network, which is owned and operated by TripAdvisor LLC.
          More details about TripAdvisor LLC can be found below under “How you can contact us.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand that providing information online involves a great deal of trust on your part. We take this
          trust very seriously, and make it a high priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal
          information you provide to us when you visit our Website or use our services. Before submitting your personal
          information to us, please read this Policy carefully to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting
          TripAdvisor’s website, www.tripadvisor.com, or using a TripAdvisor application (an “Application” or “App”) on
          a mobile phone, tablet, or similar device (a “Device”) or in connection with other sites or services, you are
          accepting the practices described herein.

        <h5>What information we collect from you</h5>
        <p class="bold">In General.</p>
        <p>
          We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This includes
          information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone
          number, postal and email addresses, user name and password, and billing information (such as your credit card
          number, cardholder name, and card expiration date). We may also request information about your travel plans,
          style, and preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program
          information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options. You can choose not to provide information to
          us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to receive relevant offerings from
          TripAdvisor and its partners and enjoy other benefits of being a registered member. For example, only
          registered members are able to post travel reviews, participate in discussion forums, email TripAdvisor
          content to themselves and others, access members-only newsletters and travel planning content, and enter
          surveys, contests, or sweepstakes. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a
          question or initiate other transactions on our site.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Information About Others.</p>
        <p>
            You will have the opportunity to provide contact and travel-related information for other people through our Website. If you make a reservation for someone else through TripAdvisor, you will need to submit that individual’s personal information. You must obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information, as any access to view or modify their information will be available only through your account.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          We may change or otherwise modify this Agreement in the future in accordance with the terms and conditions
          herein, and you understand and agree that your continued access or use of the Services after such change
          signifies your acceptance of the updated or modified Agreement. We will note the date that revisions were last
          made to this Agreement at the bottom of this Agreement, and any revisions will take effect upon posting. We
          will notify registered users of our Services (such registered users to be referred to as “Account Holders”) of
          material changes to these terms and conditions by either sending a notice to the email address associated with
          the Account Holder’s profile or by placing a notice on our websites. Be sure to return to this page
          periodically to review the most current version of this Agreement.

            USE OF THE SERVICES
            <p>
        </a>
        <p>
          As a condition of your use of the Services, you warrant that (i) all information supplied by via the Services
          to the TripAdvisor Companies is true, accurate, current and complete, (ii) if you are an Account Holder, you
          will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your
          account by anyone other than you, (iii) you are 13 years of age or older (in some jurisdictions, local laws
          may have an older age requirement) in order to register for an account, use the Services and contribute to our
          websites, and (iv) you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and to use the Services,
          including our websites in accordance with all terms and conditions herein. The TripAdvisor Companies do not
          knowingly collect the information of anyone under the age of 13. We retain the right at our sole discretion to
          deny anyone access to the Services, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for
          violation of this Agreement. By using the Services, including any products or services that facilitate the
          sharing of Content to or from third party sites, you understand that you are solely responsible for any
          information that you share with the TripAdvisor Companies. You may access the Services solely as intended
          through the provided functionality of the Services and as permitted under this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
          We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence TripAdvisor to
          improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to TripAdvisor, as well as proprietary
          algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms
          are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our
          advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
          We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have
          seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers.
          We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf)
          or negatively reviewing their competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the TripAdvisor Terms of Use, as well as
          unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time,
          effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site.
