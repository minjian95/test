      <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
      
      <p>
        Welcome to the TripAdvisor websites and mobile properties located at <a href=''>www.tripadvisor.com</a> and applicable country top level domains (including sub-domains associated with them), related software applications (sometimes referred to as “apps”), data, SMS, APIs, email, chat and telephone correspondence, buttons, widgets and ads (collectively, all of these items shall be referred to herein as the “Services”; more generally, the TripAdvisor websites and mobile properties shall hereinafter be referred to herein as “websites”). The Services are offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance of the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, this “Agreement”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and represent that you have read and understood its terms. Please read this Agreement carefully, as it contains information concerning your legal rights and limitations on these rights, as well as a section regarding applicable law and jurisdiction of disputes. If you do not accept all of these terms and conditions, you are not authorized to use the Services. If you have a TripAdvisor account and wish to terminate this Agreement, you can do so at any time by closing your account and no longer accessing or using the Services (a description of how to do so is available <a href=''>here</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Any information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, videos, data, code or other materials or arrangements of materials that you can view on, access or otherwise interact with through the Services shall be referred to as “Content”. The terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “TripAdvisor” refer to TripAdvisor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company located in the United States of America (“TripAdvisor”). “Services” as defined above refers to those provided by TripAdvisor or our corporate affiliates (TripAdvisor and such entities, when one or more are referred to, shall be collectively defined as the “TripAdvisor Companies”). For the avoidance of doubt, the websites are all owned and controlled by TripAdvisor.  However, some specific Services made available via the websites may be owned and controlled by TripAdvisor’s corporate affiliates, for example Services facilitating the booking of Vacation Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with third-party suppliers (see below). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The term “you” refers to the individual, company, business organization, or other legal entity using the Services and/or contributing Content to them. The Content that you contribute, submit, transmit and/or post to or through the Services shall be referred to variously as “your Content”, “Content of yours”, and/or “Content you submit.”
      </p>
      <p class="bold">
          The Services are provided solely to:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:1px">
        A.Assist customers in gathering travel information, posting Content, and searching for and booking travel services and reservations; and
        </p>
        <p>
        B.Assist travel, tourism and hospitality businesses in engaging with customers and potential customers, by way of free and/or paid-for services offered by or through the TripAdvisor Companies.
      </p>
       <p class="">
        We may change or otherwise modify this Agreement in the future in accordance with the terms and conditions herein, and you understand and agree that your continued access or use of the Services after such change signifies your acceptance of the updated or modified Agreement. We will note the date that revisions were last made to this Agreement at the bottom of this Agreement, and any revisions will take effect upon posting. We will notify registered users of our Services (such registered users to be referred to as “Account Holders”) of material changes to these terms and conditions by either sending a notice to the email address associated with the Account Holder’s profile or by placing a notice on our websites. Be sure to return to this page periodically to review the most current version of this Agreement.

          USE OF THE SERVICES
      <p>
      </a>
      <p>
      As a condition of your use of the Services, you warrant that (i) all information supplied by via the Services to the TripAdvisor Companies is true, accurate, current and complete, (ii) if you are an Account Holder, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by anyone other than you, (iii) you are 13 years of age or older (in some jurisdictions, local laws may have an older age requirement) in order to register for an account, use the Services and contribute to our websites, and (iv) you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and to use the Services, including our websites in accordance with all terms and conditions herein. The TripAdvisor Companies do not knowingly collect the information of anyone under the age of 13. We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny anyone access to the Services, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of this Agreement. By using the Services, including any products or services that facilitate the sharing of Content to or from third party sites, you understand that you are solely responsible for any information that you share with the TripAdvisor Companies. You may access the Services solely as intended through the provided functionality of the Services and as permitted under this Agreement.

      <p class="bold">
          We believe that everyone should play by the same rules. Businesses are not able to influence TripAdvisor to improve their reviews, ratings or Traveler Ranking.
      </p>
      <p>
          We have unique processes for moderating the content submitted to TripAdvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">
          We believe that businesses who don't play by the rules should be penalized.
      </p>
      <p>
          Businesses know that consumers rely heavily on reviews when making travel decisions. Unfortunately, we have seen over our 15 years that some unscrupulous businesses will try to cheat in order to attract more customers. We define “cheating” as positively reviewing their own business (or finding others to do so on their behalf) or negatively reviewing their competitors.
      </p>
      <p>
          These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the TripAdvisor Terms of Use, as well as unfair competition and/or consumer protection laws in many countries. We invest massive amounts of time, effort and money into identifying and blocking fraudulent activity on our site.
